## Included Structures

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
  Allows storing items sorted by price. Supports displaying items in ascending or descending order of price.

- **AVL Tree**  
  A self-balancing Binary Search Tree ensuring optimal search time by maintaining balance after each insertion/deletion.

- **Max Heap**  
  A complete binary tree where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children. Useful for sorting in descending order.

- **Min Heap**  
  A complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its children. Useful for sorting in ascending order.
